# WellsFargo Application Starter Cookbook

Cookbook with recipes for developing modern cloud native microservice, created by VMWare Tanzu Labs during the WellsFargo Enterprise Architecture Consulting engagement.



## CONTEXT

The following spring boot starters in Github will help developers to build microservices based on required business needs:
- **greenfield-app-starter** for **Non-Reactive** microservices.
- **greenfield-reactive-app-starter** for **Reactive** microservices.

You can use the **Non-Reactive** starter for migrating a _legacy application_ to a cloud-ready microservice.  
We recommended the **Reactive** starter for _greenfield applications_, to take advantage of the non-blocking behavior which improves application performance and resiliency.

## SOLUTION

### [Build Non-Reactive microservice](#non-reactive-path)

Complete the recipes in following order:
- **Create barebone microservice using the starter**
- **Configure Actuators**
- **Configure Oracle**
- **Configure MongoDB**

### [Build Reactive microservice](#reactive-path)

Complete the recipes in following order:
- **Create barebone microservice using the starter**
- **Configure Actuators**
- **Configure MongoDB**
