## Context
Let's start developing a modern _cloud ready_ microservice using the **greenfield-app-starter**.  

The starter allows you to develop a spring boot microservice based on **Non-Reactive** or **Reactive** paradigms.

Moving a legacy monolith application to a microservice, we normally use the **Non-Reactive** framework, while a greenfield microservice is recommended to use the **Reactive** to take advantage of the non-blocking behavior provided by the framework.
## Next Step
Follow the **Reactive** or **Non-Reactive** recipes depending on your business performance and resiliency needs.
