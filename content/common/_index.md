## CONTEXT
This **greenfield-app-starter** allows you to develop a spring boot microservice based on **Non-Reactive** or **Reactive** techniques.
* you can use the **Non-Reactive** path for migrating a _legacy application_ to a cloud-ready microservice.
  
* we recommended the **Reactive** path for _greenfield applications_, to take advantage of the non-blocking behavior that improves application performance and resiliency.
## Next Step
* Follow the **Create barebone microservice using the starter** recipe.
