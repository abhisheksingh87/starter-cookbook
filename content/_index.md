# Application Starter Cookbook

Cookbook for developing modern cloud native microservice created by VMware Tanzu Labs during the WellsFargo Enterprise Architecture Consulting engagement.

## Introduction
This cookbook encompasses a growing set of proven recipes that will help accelerate your journey to the cloud.

They are instrumental in sharing knowledge, so that no one has to solve the same problems again and again while scaling work. Cookbook uses **Hugo** static web site generator, and recipes are written in _Markdown_.

A recipe is a short article explaining how to solve a specific problem, or providing step-by-step instructions for completing a task. Recipes can include code snippets, patterns, or best practices.
